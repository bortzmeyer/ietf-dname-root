<abstract>
<t>This documents asks IANA to add DNAME records in the DNS root for
TLDs which are in the Special-Use Domain Names registry, in order to ensure they receive an
appropriate reply (NXDOMAIN) and that the root is not too bothered by them.</t>
<t>REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: there is no obvious place to discuss
this document. May be the
IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) group, through its mailing list (the
author reads it). Or may AS112 operators mailing lists? The
source of the document, as well as a list of open issues, is currently
kept <eref
target="https://github.com/bortzmeyer/ietf-dname-root">at Github</eref>.</t>

  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction and background">
    <t>The DNS root receives a lot of requests for TLDs which do not
    exist. See for instance <xref
    target="fujiwara-root-traffic"/> or <xref
    target="icann-l-root-stats"/> or <xref target="ssac-045"/>. In the spirit of <xref target="RFC7534"/>, it would be good
    if they could be redirected to a sink such as AS112, to save
    root's resources.</t>
     <t>Some of these names, and specially one of the biggest
     offenders, .local (<xref target="RFC6762"/>), are registered in
     the <eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/special-use-domain-names/special-use-domain-names.xml">Special-Use Domain Names registry</eref> of <xref
     target="RFC6761"/>. They are obvious candidates for a delegation to
     the sink.</t>
     <t>It is proposed to use the new AS112, the one described by
     <xref target="RFC7535"/> to implement this sink.</t>
     <t>TODO: results of the discussion with AS112 people</t>
     <section title="Requirements Terminology">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
</section>
  </section>

  <section anchor="rules" title="Rules">
    <t>Every TLD (<xref target="RFC7719"/>, section 2) which is in the
    <eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/special-use-domain-names/special-use-domain-names.xml">Special-Use Domain Names registry</eref> (<xref target="RFC6761"/>)
    SHOULD be delegated by IANA through a DNAME to empty.as112.arpa as
    described in <xref target="RFC7535"/> if and only if the
    registration of this TLD say that resolvers should not or must
    not look them up in the DNS.</t>
   <t>It is important to notice that this document does not define a
   policy to decide if a TLD should be "delegated" or not. Instead, it
   relies on the existing Special-Use Domain Names registry and its
   rules.</t>
    <t>RFC-EDITOR: remove before publication. As of today, with these rules, .local (<xref target="RFC6762"/>)
   or .onion (<xref
    target="RFC7686"/>) would be delegated but not .example (its
    registration in <xref target="RFC6761"/> does not define special
    handling for resolvers) or .home or .belkin (this last one generates a huge
    traffic at the root but is not in the Special-Use Domain Names registry).</t>
  </section>

<section anchor="benefits" title="Benefits">
  <t>The main benefit is less load on the root and a better efficiency
  of the caches, therefore helping the entire DNS ecosystem.</t>
</section>

<section title="Possible issues">
  <t>Of course, the solution described in this document requires a
  good support of DNAME by the resolvers. Appendix A of <xref
  target="RFC7535"/> describes an experiment which was run in 2013 and
  which shows that, indeed, we can rely on DNAME (quoting the authors:
  "We conclude that there is no evidence of a consistent
   failure on the part of deployed DNS resolvers to correctly resolve a
   DNAME construct.").</t>
  <t>Regarding DNSSEC, do note the future DNAMEs in the root will be
  signed, but the target, empty.as112.arpa, is not. See <eref
  target="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dnsop/JsPNz66aQE3-r3toawCV_ajoCNo">George
  Michaelson's message</eref>. So, it will not be possible to validate
  the answers. Not a problem since these requests should never have
  been sent to the root, anyway.</t>
</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>IANA is requested (TODO what is the appropriate wording?) to add a
DNAME in the root for every TLD which fits the rules of <xref
target="rules"/>.</t>
<t>RFC-EDITOR: remove before publication. There is currently no DNAME
in the root. It is expected that the creation of the first one will
require a top-down, multi-stakeholder, long and complicated process
with a lot of meetings, reports by consultants and design teams.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>The requests for the TLD in the Special-Use Domain Names registry
are typically NOT supposed to leak to the authoritative public name
servers such as the ones of the root. If they do, it means a
misconfiguration somewhere. The leak is independant on whether the name is delegated to AS112 or
not. See
section 8 of <xref
target="RFC7534"/> for an analysis. Some people believe there are added risks, because the queries will be seen by AS112
servers which, unlike the root, are managed by many "random people".</t>
</section>

<section title="Acknowledgments">
<t>Thanks to Paul Hoffman to say that it may be a good idea and for
Ted Lemon to give the final impulse, with his <xref target="I-D.tldr-sutld-ps"/>.</t>
