<abstract>
<t>This documents asks IANA to add DNAME records in the DNS root for
TLDs which are in the Special-Use Domain Names registry, in order to ensure they receive an
appropriate reply (NXDOMAIN) and that the root is not too bothered by them.</t>
<t>REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: there is no obvious place to discuss
this document. May be the
IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) group, through its mailing list (the
author reads it). Or may AS112 operators mailing lists? The
source of the document, as well as a list of open issues, is currently
kept <eref
target="https://github.com/bortzmeyer/ietf-dname-root">at Github</eref>.</t>

  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction and background">
    <t>The DNS root receives a lot of requests for TLDs which do not
    exist. In the spirit of <xref target="RFC7534"/>, it would be good
    if they could be redirected to a sink such as AS112, to save
    root's resources. TODO references to one of the many DNS-OARC
    talks about these junk requests.</t>
     <t>Some of these names, and specially one of the biggest
     offenders, .local (<xref target="RFC6762"/>), are registered in
     the <eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/special-use-domain-names/special-use-domain-names.xml">Special-Use Domain Names registry</eref> of <xref
     target="RFC6761"/>. They are obvious candidates for a delegation to
     the sink.</t>
     <t>It is proposed to use the new AS112, the one described by
     <xref target="RFC7535"/> to implement this sink.</t>
     <t>TODO requires discussion with AS112 people</t>
      <section title="Requirements Terminology">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
</section>
  </section>

  <section anchor="rules" title="Rules">
    <t>Every TLD (<xref target="RFC7719"/>, section 2) which is in the
    <eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/special-use-domain-names/special-use-domain-names.xml">Special-Use Domain Names registry</eref> (<xref target="RFC6761"/>)
    SHOULD be delegated by IANA through a DNAME to empty.as112.arpa as
    described in <xref target="RFC7535"/> if and only if the
    registration of these TLD say that resolvers should not or must
    not look them up in the DNS.</t>
   <t>It is important to notice that this document does not define a
   policy to decide if a TLD should be delegated or not. Instead, it
   relies on the existing Special-Use Domain Names registry and its
   rules.</t>
    <t>RFC-EDITOR: remove before publication. As of today, with these rules, .local (<xref target="RFC6762"/>)
   or .onion (<xref
    target="RFC7686"/>) would be delegated but not .example (its
    registration in <xref target="RFC6761"/> does not define special
    handling for resolvers) or .home or .belkin (which generate a huge
    traffic at the root but are not in the Special-Use Domain Names registry.</t>
  </section>

<section anchor="benefits" title="Benefits">
  <t>The main benefit is less load on the root and a better efficiency of the caches.</t>
  <t>TODO mention RFC 6303?</t>
</section>

<section title="Possible issues">
  <t>TODO support of DNAME (there is certainly a Geoff Huston survey
  of DNAMEs in the wild; there is also appendix A of <xref target="RFC7535"/>).</t>
  <t>TODO interaction with DNSSEC. The DNAMEs in the root will be
  signed, the target, empty.as112.arpas is not. See <eref
  target="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dnsop/JsPNz66aQE3-r3toawCV_ajoCNo">George
  Michaelson's message</eref>.</t>
</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>IANA is requested (TODO what is the appropriate wording?) to add a
DNAME in the root for every TLD which fits the rules of <xref
target="rules"/>.</t>
<t>RFC-EDITOR: remove before publication. There is currently no DNAME
in the root. It is expected that the creation of the first one will
require a top-down, multi-stakeholder, long and complicated process
with a lot of meetings, reports by consultants and design teams.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>TODO: leaks, privacy. Copy from the section 9 of <xref
target="RFC7534"/> ?</t>
</section>

<section title="Acknowledgments">
<t>Thanks to Paul Hoffman to say that it may be a good idea and for
Ted Lemon to give the final impulse, with his <xref target="I-D.tldr-sutld-ps"/>.</t>
